# FlowAgent: AI-Powered Water Access System

**"AI Agent → MCP → Blockchain → Physical Water Pump"**

## 🌊 Overview
FlowAgent is an AI agent that manages decentralized water access using Model Context Protocol (MCP) and blockchain automation. The system enables autonomous water distribution through SMS payments, Web3 transactions, and IoT hardware control.

## 🤖 AI Agent Architecture
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol for agent communication
- **Water Management Agent**: Autonomous decision-making for water distribution
- **Blockchain Integration**: Multi-chain payment processing
- **IoT Control**: ESP32-based pump automation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- ESP32 with SIM800L module
- MetaMask wallet

### 1. Launch System
```bash
cd /home/josh/Kiro/FlowAgent
